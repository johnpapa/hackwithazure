# Hack for good - sponsored by Microsoft

At select hackathons, Microsoft is sponsoring the Hack for Good prize. This prize is awarded to the team who makes the best use of Azure or another Microsoft service or product in their team's project to help improve the world. Your team could create an app to help marginalized communities, advance efforts to reduce climate change, or anything which helps make the planet better for everyone.

For more information, you can contact the Microsoft representative at your hackathon. You can also find the scoring rubric below.
