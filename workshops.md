# Hack workshops

Want to learn more about Azure? Don't want to just walk through a series of steps in a prescriptive lab? We've created a series of hack-based workshops to help educate and inspire you!

## The structure

Each hack-based workshop is built around a common hackathon scenario. You and your team will work together to achieve the goals put forth, learning by doing. After completing a workshop your team will have performed the actual activities you'll perform to bring your project onto Azure, a set of assets you can continue to build upon, and ideas for using the scenario as a seed for your team's hack.

You will notice the structure is a bit different from normal workshops. In particular, there are no step-by-step instructions provided. Instead the workshop is broken down into a series of goals for your team to complete. Each goal has well defined criteria for success, and a series of links to all the necessary resources for achieving the goal. We find this self-exploration model works really well to help absorb the information. The goals are designed to be progressive, with each building on the one before it.

## The hacks

### The Loved Mutt

[The Loved Mutt](https://github.com/microsoft/hack-workshop-web) is an organization to help rescue dogs find their forever homes. They have developed a website people can use to come up with names for dogs they see. They would like to publish the website to the cloud, and need a database to go with it. Your team will work to deploy the site to [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-cxa) and add [Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/introduction?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-cxa). After completion your team will have a deployment pipeline created, and have learned how to configure the website including authentication.
